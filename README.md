**Overview**

This repository contains a Python tool to analyze product pricing, compare it with simulated market prices, and generate insights. Outputs include a markdown report (report.md) and an updated CSV (updated_products.csv).

The tool is designed for Google Colab and includes a notebook for easy setup and execution.

**Features**

Simulates market prices with ±20% variation.

Provides recommendations to adjust or maintain prices.

**Approach Summary**

Simulates market prices with random ±20% variation.

Analyzes pricing using ±10% thresholds:

"Raise price" if significantly below market.

"Lower price" if significantly above market.

"Competitive" if within range.

Outputs detailed recommendations and summaries in a markdown report and updated CSV.

**Known Limitations**

Market prices are simulated and may not reflect real-world data.

Fixed ±10% thresholds might not suit all industries.

Google Colab requires manual file uploads and downloads.
